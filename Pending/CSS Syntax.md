## CSS Basics

As HTML is a language made up entirely of 'elements', css is a language made up entirely of 'rule-sets'. HTML places content into buckets that become a nested structure in memory. The computer has preset rules that enable it to render images based off that structure. When HTML first came out, the list of rules and options for each rule was more limited and was not called CSS. CSS came along later and took over the job of deciding what the list or rules were and what the options for each of those rules would be. Therefore it can be said that CSS gives the computer the programs it needs to take the nested HTML structure and render the image. When using CSS, the user is not actually programming any functions or routines, but merely stating which of the possible options they want CSS to use when rendering html elements that make up the image.

Becuase CSS is a language of specifications and not actual programs, the syntax of CSS will be simpler than other languages, becuase it has a more specific function, and less to do. CSS is made up of chunks of code called 'rule-sets'. Rule-Sets are composted of an initial bit of code called the selector which is followed by the declaration block.

Rule-Set

A selector and a declaraction block filled with property-value pairs

 `HTML-TAG { PROPERTY: VALUE, PROPERTY: VALUE }`

Selector

The syntax that specifies the html tag you want to adjust the render properties of.

`HTML-TAG`

Declaration Block

The list, bookended with curly brackets, that states the properties that the user wants to specify and the values the user wants those properties specified too.

`{ PROPERTY: VALUE, PROPERTY: VALUE }`

Property-Value Pair

A pair of words that specifies a property and a value for that property. The two words are seperated by colons, and the pairs are seperated by commas.

`PROPERTY: VALUE`

## Being Good with CSS and HTML
Being good as css and html is not a matter of advanced intelligence and understanding of algorithms like it takes to be good in JS or C. CSS and HTML are a place where the largest payout just comes from remembering a few things and not overthinking. There is some higher level thought in figuring out what to adjust the property of in a complex interaction of multiply html elements, but even that is something you can learn pretty quick. At the end of the day CSS and HTML are not as hard to understand as other languages, so try not to stress out about it as much. I did and it was a large waste of time for me. Just memorize the structure of selectors and the properties you need too and stay organized in your code and you should be fine. And don't feel bad about looking up css properties and selectors when working on projects, I do it all the time.

## Selectors

As laid out by w3schools.com, We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class) <br>
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them) <br>
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state) <br>
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element) <br>
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) <br>
